# Weldr Monorepo Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
Weldr is a TypeScript-based monorepo using pnpm workspaces, Turbo, and modern web technologies. The project consists of AI-powered web applications with a focus on code generation, project management, and integrations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Type Safety is Non-Negotiable
- **ALWAYS** use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **NEVER** use `any` type - use `unknown` and proper type guards instead
- **ALWAYS** define explicit return types for functions
- **ALWAYS** use Zod schemas for runtime validation of external data
- **PREFER** type inference where it maintains clarity
- **ALWAYS** use `satisfies` operator for const assertions with type checking
- **ALWAYS** use branded types for IDs and sensitive data
- **PREFER** union types over enums for better type safety
- **USE** `as const` assertions for immutable data structures

### 2. Code Organization & Architecture
- Follow the existing monorepo structure strictly
- Apps in `/apps`, shared packages in `/packages`
- Use workspace protocol for internal dependencies: `workspace:*`
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between packages
- **APPLY** single responsibility principle when functions or components become very complicated
- **GROUP** related functionality into cohesive modules
- **AVOID** circular dependencies between packages
- **USE** barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean public APIs
- **ORGANIZE** files by feature, not by type

### 3. Import Organization & Dependencies
- Follow Biome import organization rules (already configured)
- Order: Node builtins → External packages → @weldr packages → Relative imports
- Use blank lines to separate import groups
- **PREFER** named imports over default imports for better tree-shaking
- **AVOID** importing entire libraries when only specific functions are needed
- **USE** type-only imports for TypeScript types: `import type { ... }`
- **KEEP** dependencies minimal - question every new dependency

### 4. Error Handling & Resilience
- **ALWAYS** use try-catch blocks for async operations
- **ALWAYS** handle errors explicitly - no silent failures
- Use TRPCError for API errors with appropriate codes
- Log errors before re-throwing or handling
- **NEVER** expose sensitive information in error messages
- **IMPLEMENT** circuit breakers for external service calls
- **USE** Result types for operations that can fail gracefully
- **PROVIDE** meaningful error messages that help users understand what went wrong
- **IMPLEMENT** retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **VALIDATE** error boundaries in React components

### 5. Database & Data Access Excellence
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- **ALWAYS** use transactions for multi-step operations
- **ALWAYS** validate input with Zod schemas before database operations
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries
- **NEVER** concatenate SQL strings directly
- **INDEX** foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- **USE** connection pooling with appropriate limits
- **IMPLEMENT** database migrations with rollback strategies
- **MONITOR** query performance and optimize slow queries
- **CACHE** expensive queries appropriately
- **USE** read replicas for read-heavy operations when available

### 6. Performance & Optimization
- **IMPLEMENT** lazy loading for large components and routes
- **USE** React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback judiciously
- **OPTIMIZE** bundle size with code splitting
- **IMPLEMENT** efficient pagination for large datasets
- **USE** streaming for real-time data updates
- **CACHE** API responses with appropriate TTL
- **MINIMIZE** re-renders through proper state management
- **PROFILE** performance bottlenecks regularly
- **OPTIMIZE** images with proper formats and sizes
- **USE** CDN for static assets

### 7. Security Best Practices
- **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- **ALWAYS** validate and sanitize user input
- Use proper authentication checks (protectedProcedure)
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- **ENCRYPT** sensitive data at rest
- **USE** HTTPS for all communications
- **IMPLEMENT** CORS policies appropriately
- **VALIDATE** file uploads for type and size
- **ESCAPE** user input to prevent XSS
- **USE** parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **IMPLEMENT** proper session management
- **AUDIT** dependencies for security vulnerabilities regularly

### 8. Code Quality & Maintainability
- **WRITE** self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- **KEEP** functions small and focused (max 20-30 lines)
- **AVOID** deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- **USE** early returns to reduce complexity
- **EXTRACT** magic numbers and strings into named constants
- **PREFER** composition over inheritance
- **IMPLEMENT** consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- **REFACTOR** code regularly to reduce technical debt
- **REMOVE** dead code and unused imports regularly

### 9. Monitoring & Observability
- **IMPLEMENT** structured logging with appropriate log levels
- **TRACK** key business metrics and KPIs
- **MONITOR** application performance and errors
- **SET UP** alerts for critical failures
- **USE** distributed tracing for complex operations
- **MEASURE** user experience metrics
- **IMPLEMENT** health checks for all services
- **LOG** user actions for analytics and debugging
- **MONITOR** resource usage and scaling metrics

## Package-Specific Guidelines

### @weldr/db
- Define all schemas with proper TypeScript types
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Export both schema and validator from same module
- Maintain migration files properly

### @weldr/api
- Each router should have dedicated file
- Use protectedProcedure for authenticated routes
- Return consistent error responses
- Implement proper pagination where needed

### @weldr/ui
- Components must be fully typed with proper props interfaces
- Use forwardRef for components that need ref forwarding
- Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind classes
- Export all icons from central index

### @weldr/shared
- Place all shared types, validators, and utilities here
- No UI code in shared package
- Keep dependencies minimal

### @weldr/auth
- Centralize all authentication logic
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper token refresh logic

## Code Style Rules

### **Comments Policy**
- **ONLY add comments for very complex work** that requires explanation
- **NEVER ADD** explanatory comments for simple operations:
  - ❌ `// Delete this because user requested`
  - ❌ `// Making this true because user asked`  
  - ❌ `// Process the request here`
  - ❌ `// Handle user input`
  - ❌ `// Implementation details`
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming instead

## File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file names: `user-profile.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for component files that export components
- Use camelCase for utility files
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Type definition files: `*.d.ts` or `types.ts`

## Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits (enforced by commitizen)
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Run `pnpm commit` for guided commit creation

## Common Commands
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev          # Start all dev servers
pnpm build        # Build all packages
pnpm typecheck    # Run TypeScript type checking
pnpm check:fix    # Fix linting issues

# Database
pnpm db:push      # Push schema changes
pnpm db:generate  # Generate migrations
pnpm db:migrate   # Run migrations
pnpm db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio

# Code Quality
pnpm lint:staged  # Run linter on staged files
pnpm commit       # Create conventional commit
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Using `any` type
- ❌ Ignoring TypeScript errors with @ts-ignore
- ❌ Direct DOM manipulation in React components
- ❌ Synchronous operations in async contexts
- ❌ Hardcoded configuration values
- ❌ Console.log in production code (use proper logging)
- ❌ Uncommitted generated files
- ❌ Mixed import styles (require/import)
- ❌ Non-validated external data
- ❌ SQL injection vulnerabilities

## Performance Guidelines
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Cache expensive computations
- Use database indexes appropriately

## AI Agent Development
- Tools must have clear, single responsibilities
- Validate all tool inputs with Zod schemas
- Stream responses for better UX
